# CDMS 📊  
CDMS is a simple Charity Donation Management System built for educational purposes. It helps manage donors, donations, and beneficiaries efficiently. This was originally created for a school project.

## 🚨 Disclaimer

This was a school project. Please **reconsider your life choices and sense of professionality** before attempting to use this commercially.  
Also, I **don’t care** if someone decides to copy or steal it — it’s open-source for a reason. Enjoy.
